## Summary

My first C Sharp project, the C Sharp Battleship Console App. I liked doing this as an intro to C sharp because it was more logic
based and it was a good reset into another language. I was pleaseantly surprised to find the similarities from JavaScript.

I learned a lot about time management during this project. After becoming a new father to twins I had to learn about committing the
little time I had to make sure I was able to complete it.
